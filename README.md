# TicTacToe

 - **This was made as a side project only for educational purposes.**
 
 This program is pretty self explanatory being a Tic-tac-toe board game. Its not the best, but as a side project it will be updated and maintained overtime as long as i see 
 fit. The UI needs to be worked and many features till need to be added. Check the "Upcoming Feature" list below this to see whats to come. Download tutorial for this application
 is down below as well. Any constructive feedback or bugs reports are welcome.
